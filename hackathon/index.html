                    The article explores agent patterns in Quarkus, 
                    which differ from workflow patterns by letting LLMs orchestrate the control flow 
                    instead of using programmatic definitions. The article demonstrates this through 
                    three examples: a weather forecast agent that coordinates multiple services 
                    to provide weather information, a general-purpose AI agent utilizing web search 
                    capabilities for broader tasks, and a restaurant booking chatbot that manages 
                    conversations with customers while handling reservations.

                    The article discusses AI workflow patterns in Quarkus, 
                    focusing on three main patterns: prompt chaining, parallelization, and routing. 
                    Prompt chaining involves sequential LLM calls where output from one becomes 
                    input for another (demonstrated with a creative writing example), 
                    while parallelization allows independent LLM calls to run simultaneously 
                    (shown with an evening planner combining movie and meal suggestions).

                    The article introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers project, 
                    which enables AI models to interact with applications and services in a decoupled way. 
                    The project currently features three Quarkus-based servers: a JDBC server for 
                    database interactions, a Filesystem server for file system access, 
                    and a JavaFX server for drawing capabilities. The project leverages 
                    Quarkus's programming model, the extensive Java ecosystem, 
                    and native executable capabilities to provide a powerful foundation 
                    for building AI-powered applications.
